## Reporting Bugs & Feature Requests

If you would like to submit a feature request or report a bug, we encourage you to first look through the [issues](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-collapsible/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-collapsible/pulls) before filing a new issue.


## Submitting a Pull Request

If you wish to submit a pull request for a new feature or issue, you should start by forking this repository first. This should get you setup on your local machine:

### Setup

*  Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) if you have not already. (*We suggest you to use node v6.x.x*)
*  Fork the repo
* ```git clone https://github.com/oblador/react-native-collapsible.git && cd react-native-collapsible```
* ```yarn install``` OR ```npm install```
* ```npm test```

One you have done this, create a new branch with a name that loosely describes the issue on which you will be working. Once you think you have the addressed the issue in question, submit a pull request to the `next` branch.
